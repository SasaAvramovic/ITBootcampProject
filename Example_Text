Seven Bridges Automation Task
Automation project containing test solutions for UI testing (search on website kupujemprodajem).
Tests are written in Python using Selenium.
All task requirements can be found in test_requirements.txt.
For running you will need:
python version 3.6+
some IDE (I used PyCharm)
python libs:
selenium (how to install it: https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
html-testRunner (how to install it: https://pypi.org/project/html-testRunner/)
lxml (how to install it: https://pypi.org/project/lxml/)
already in project, but probably worth mentioning - chromedriver
To run tests, clone this code to your local machine, navigate to the file : tests/test_suite/TestSuite.py and run it.
After test run the reports will be generated in output directory. They can be open by any desired browser.
